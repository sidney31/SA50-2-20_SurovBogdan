            One of the castles was to be founded inside London, already the largest English town in those times.
            The so-called Tower of London was built on remains of an ancient Roman fortification, and initially was built mainly from timber. 
            Only a hundred years later it was reinforced with stone. The castle takes its name from the White Tower, 
            which is the name of the main keep that still stands as of today. People from other towns referred to it as The Tower of London, 
            and eventually it became a name widespread3 enough to stick.
            Given its location and strategic importance, the castle soon became a residence for the richest and the most influential people across England. 
            Over the years the castle has expanded greatly, because each of its owners was always seeking to add something distinct4 to its fortifications. 
            One of the darker stories of that age is the tale of the Princes in the Tower, two young boys of royal blood who were declared illegitimate 
            and then murdered by some unknown assailant5. Remains of two boys were found inside the castle in a wooden box in 1674.
            Starting in the 16th century, the castle started to see its use as a royal residence. It gained much notoriety6 in following years though, 
            as it was also used as a prison and a place of execution for people whod fall out of favour with their rulers.
            In modern times The Tower of London became less ominous7. At some point8 there was even a zoo inside. It started as a collection of royal 
            pets that quickly outgrew its accommodations9 and was soon moved to the London Zoo located inside Regents Park. Its still open nowadays 
            and is a popular tourist landmark.
